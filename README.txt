Innovation - Experimentation - Collaboration

The Global Game Jam® (GGJ) is the world's largest game jam event (game creation) taking place around the world at physical locations. 
Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. 
It is the growth of an idea that in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using 
video games – it is very universal. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games, while at the same time exploring the process of development, be it programming, iterative 
design, narrative exploration or artistic expression. It is all condensed into a 48 hour development cycle. The GGJ encourages people with all kinds of backgrounds to participate 
and contribute to this global spread of game development and creativity.

The structure of a jam is usually that everyone gathers on Friday late afternoon, watches a short video keynote with advice from leading game developers, and then a secret theme 
is announced. All sites worldwide are then challenged to make games based on that same theme, with games to be completed by Sunday afternoon. In January 2017, we had 700 locations
in 95 countries create over 7000 games in one weekend! GGJ 2018 is January 26-28 at a location near you… if not you can make one of your own. 
The jam is known for helping foster new friendships, increase confidence and opportunities within the community. The jam is always an intellectual challenge. 
People are invited to explore new technology tools, trying on new roles in development and testing their skills to do something that requires them to design, develop create, test 
and make a new game in the time span of 48 hours.

The GGJ stimulates collaboration and is not a competition.
